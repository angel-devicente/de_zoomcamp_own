+ 3.1.1 Data Warehouse and BigQuery
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrHljAoD6nM&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=25

  OLAP vs OLTP
  On-line Analytical Processing vs On-line Transaction Processing

  Data warehouse is an OLAP solution, used for reporting and data analysis

  BigQuery is a serverless data warehouse

  BigQuery Cost
   On demand pricing
    1TB of processed data is $5
   Flat rate pricing

  We can use external tables (i.e. the data coming, for example from a GS Bucket).

  See example queries for this part in file big_query.sql of
  dezoomcamp-code/week_3_data_warehouse

  What is partitioning? For example creating sub-tables by the date, so queries
  that filter by date will be much faster.

  Clustering
    Clustering for example by Tag

+ 3.1.2 Partitioning and Clustering
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-CqXf7vhhDs&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=26

  Just more details about partitioning and clustering

  Automatic reclustering can be very useful as new data is added.
  It is done in the background, no user intervention needed.

+ 3.2.1 BigQuery Best Practices

  avoid select *
 
  a list of adivces, difficult to understand without examples for those of us
  with little experience with SQL and/or BigQuery


+ 3.2.2 Internals of BigQuery
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eduHi1inM4s&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=28

  Basically leart that somehow execution and storage are separated in BigQuery,
  and that when BigQuery is going to process a query, it is divided into smaller
  chunks, which get executed separately for speed, and later joined together to
  obain the final result.

+ 3.3.1 BigQuery Machine Learning
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-WtpB0PuG4&list=PL3MmuxUbc_hJed7dXYoJw8DoCuVHhGEQb&index=29

  See example queries for this part in file big_query_ml.sql of
  dezoomcamp-code/week_3_data_warehouse
  
  Documentation at: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery-ml/docs

  He built a simple linear regression model (similar to what we did in the first
  days of the ML-Zoomcamp course, but with BigQuery)

+ 3.3.2 BigQuery Machine Learning Deployment

  How to export and Deploy the model as a Docker image.

  See extract_model.md in dezoomcamp-code/week_3_data_warehouse

  gcloud auth login works fine
  bq is not in the path, but rather in /opt/google-cloud-sdk/bin
  
  (these were installed by AUR package google-cloud-sdk)

  The stuff he uses to test the Docker image with the model is Postman:

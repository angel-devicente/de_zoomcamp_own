All materials for Week #4 are at:

+ 4.1.1 Analytics Engineering Basics

  Analytics Engineers: somehwere between data engineers (who take care of the data
  infrastructure) and data analysts (who use the data to answer business/science
  questions). 

  Data loading -> data storing -> data modelling -> data presentation.

  In this week we'll look at dbt (data modelling) and data presentation.

  Data modelling concepts: ELT vs ETL
   Kimball' Dimensional modelling
   Elements of Dimensional modeling
   Architecture of Dimensional modeling (stage area, precessing area, presentation
   area) 
 
+ 4.1.2 What is dbt

  stands for Data build tool (transformation tool going from SQL to analytics code
  following software engineerin best practices)

  Basically we will write some SQL code, that dbt will compile and push back to
  the warehouse, creating a persistent derived model of our data, that we can
  later use.

  How to use dbt?
  + dbt Core
    + open source
  + dbt Cloud
    + Saas application to develop and manage dbt projects
    + Web-based IDE, et.
    + Free for individuals

  How are we going to use dbt?
  + BigQuery: development using cloud IDE
  + Postgres: local installation

+ 4.2.1 Start your dbt Projcet: BigQuery and dbt cloud (Alternative A)

+ Create a new dbt project
  + dbt starter project repo: https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-starter-project

  + if using dbt locally, dbt init would clone the repo above so that we start
    with a template
  + if using dbt cloud, we would get it by starting a new project in the
    web-based IDE

The videos don't show some basic steps (how to create a dbt cloud account,
etc. For that, check the following info:

+ 4.2.2 Start your dbt Projcet: Postgres and dbt

+ 4.3.1 Build the First dbt models

+ 4.3.2 Testing and documenting the project

+ 4.4.1 Deployment using dbt cloud 

+ 4.4.2 Deployment using dbt locally

+ 4.5.1 Visualizing the data with Google Data Sudio

+ 4.5.2 Visualizing the data with Metabase

+ Question 3

  First we need to upload yellow taxi data for 2019/02 and 2019/03 to GCS.
  For that, after creating the data/yellow directory we run:
     python etl_web_to_gcs_Q3.py 
   which downloads it locally and uploads the data to GCS Bucket

  The code is in etl_gcs_to_bq.py
  To create the deployment:
    prefect deployment build ./etl_gcs_to_bq.py:etl_gcs_to_bq -n "Homework Q3"
  Edit etl_gcs_to_bq-deployment.yaml, so tha parameters is:
  parameters: {'sets': [{'color': "yellow", 'year': 2019,'month': 2},
                      {'color': "yellow", 'year': 2019,'month': 3}]}
  Apply the deployment by doing:
    prefect deployment apply etl_gcs_to_bq-deployment.yaml

  Start the agent with 
    prefect agent start -q 'default'

  In the Orion UI, go to the newly created deployment (Homework Q3) and click on
  Quick Run.

  We see that the agent starts logging information about the different flows,
  and towards the end we get the line:

   11:31:36.276 | INFO    | Flow run 'sparkling-mamba' - Total rows added: 14851920

  -> 14,851,920
